## About
The *Advanced Auto Retry* mod changes the behavior for Geometry Dash's vanilla "Auto Retry" game setting. It allows the player to add certain conditions to make the auto-retry work differently for reaching a certain percentage or a new best.

### Configuration
A button will appear on the right-hand side of the pause menu that creates a pop-up of the mod's settings to allow you to change the settings while in the level.
